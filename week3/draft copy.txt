Content Sections:
Styles of Dance: This section is where all of the different types of dance will be. From there, the user can select one style and it will direct them to a page that goes into detail about
that type of dance. It will also have links to YouTube videos and include one or two pictures displaying the dance. Each section should end with a fun fact, and the option
to return to the top of the page. Since there are many types, the page will be sorted by letter with each "A" or "B" (etc.) bolded and large. 
Basically, each genre will lead a user to a page with a description, picture and video, fun fact, country of origin, and well-known dancers of the category.

Famous Dancers: This section will be in the same style of the Genre section. There will be a picture, background of the dancer, their style of dance, a video (if applicable), country of origin,
and will tell how the dancer got into the style and for how many years.

Search by Countries: This page will allow the user to view a list of countries. Clicking on the country will bring up a list of genres of dance originted from that country.

About the Author: This section will tell the user a bit about myself and what dancing means to me. I will also list the styles I have danced, for how many years, and 
include what dancing has taught me. I will also include my email address so people can get in touch with any suggestions and feedback for my site.
This will be the only personal page of the website.
