For my style tiles, I wanted to pick a color scheme that would work well together,
as well as be pleasing to the eye. An aesthetic color scheme is inviting and will help
with clear navigation. The first was more colorful, but did not seem very professional
so with my second one I thought a blue and gold theme looked more put together and the
colors did not distract from the content. I spent about an hour on each style tile to
make sure I liked the placement and made adjustments based on feedback from my friends.
I believe that having more than one style tile is definitely the way to go, as you may 
discover that other color schemes go better together than others, which ultimately affects
the way your website is perceived by the viewer.
